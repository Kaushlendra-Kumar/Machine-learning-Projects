Projects on Classification

Mask no Mask Detection: Developed a classification model using Tensorflow Deep learning to detect if a person is wearing a mask or not Using Webcam. Achieved 93% accuracy on validation data after learning the model using over 1000 images.

Inorganic Organic waste classification : Developed and trained a classifier to classify contents of image as either organic or inorganic waste. Achieved 90% test accuracy on 22500 images from Kaggle. Worked on Convolution, pooling, and plotting loss curves.

Fake or True news Text based Classification : Trained a classification learning model to classify news as True or Fake using Tensorflow Natural Language Processing Library. Achieved 99% accuracy on Validation data after training the model on over 40k news in Kaggle Dataset.

Understanding and Predicting Property Maintenance Fines : Trained a predicting model to predict whether a person will pay the property fine on time or not using SVC SkLearn. Achieved 95% accuracy on validation data. Based on data challenge from Michigan Data Science Team.

Identification of Alphabets in Sign Language: Developed a classifier to identify 26 English alphabets in sign language using Tensorflow deep learning with 92% accuracy.
